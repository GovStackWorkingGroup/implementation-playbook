# Prototype

## Develop, test, and iterate a functional prototype.

Once the [wireframe ](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/design-and-delivery/wireframes)[and/or voice command flow](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/design-and-delivery/wireframes) is approved, we are ready to start developing and orchestrating a functional prototype of the service. The prototype is iteratively developed. Each successive iteration adds new functionalities and refines the prototype based on user feedback. This results in a service that meets the desired level of functionality and usability.

<summary>What are the benefits of protoyping?</summary>

Prototyping an e-service allows:

* Pre-procurement testing of software solutions
* Technical feasibility check
* Requirement gathering (e.g.BPMs) for procurement
* Transparency of the inner functioning of the Building Block approach
* Reference set-up for development, deployment, and operating life cycle
* Testing the Frontend with Users/Citizens

{% tab title="Activities  / Resources" %}
* Develop Product and Technical specifications for the service.
* Develop the front end and back end of the service according to the Product and Technical specifications and approved wireframes and/or voice command flow. &#x20;
* Develop a test script considering all the branches of "To-Be" user journey. &#x20;
* Prepare
  * test scripts
  * security and quality assurance checklist &#x20;
  * digital service release plan &#x20;
  * stabilization and maintenance routine &#x20;
* Refer [GovStack sandbox](https://govstack.gitbook.io/sandbox) documentation and prototype service using rapid prototyping tools. Learn more about the use of prototyping tools by reading the [Do It Yourself (DIY) Full Stack Sction](https://govstack.gitbook.io/sandbox/follow-methodology/diy/diy-full-stack) of GovStack Sandbox documentation.
* Launch α, β versions to a limited set of citizens/business users, admins, and public officials.&#x20;
* Collect their feedback on the functional prototype and identify concrete steps to improve it.
* Iteratively developed and deliver the launch version that meets the requirements and needs of citizens/business users, admins, and public officials.
* Prepare the plan for migration of the prototype to the production environment.&#x20;
* Prepare the launch of the service.

<summary>Iterative prototyping</summary>

Following are the stages of prototyping a digital government service, from α version to the Launch version:

* α version prototype: α version is a rough functional prototype used to test the initial concept and get feedback from a limited number of users and stakeholders. The duration for the α version must be agreed upon between service owners and stakeholders. It usually lasts between a few weeks and months. α version can be hosted in a testing environment that may or may not be the GovStack Sandbox.
*   β version prototype: Once the α version is tested and feedback is collected, the β version is developed. This prototype is more refined and is closer to the final digital service. It includes more features and functionalities and is tested by a larger group of users or stakeholders to identify any final issues before launching the next iteration.

    In case the β version is hosted on GovStack Sandbox, preparations must be made to deploy it on the country's cloud infrastructure/ production environment.
* Launch version: The launch version is the first version of the service that is released to the public. It includes the core features and functionalities that meet the needs of the users and are further iterated based on future user feedback.&#x20;
